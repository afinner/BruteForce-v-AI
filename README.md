# AIvBF: N-Dimensional Tic-Tac-Toe Game Engine Comparison
The **AIvBF** repository is dedicated to implementing and measuring the performance of two game engines: a **Q-learning AI** and a **Brute Force** algorithm in the context of N-dimensional tic-tac-toe. This project allows you to explore and compare the strategies employed by these two engines.

## Features
1. Q-learning AI:
   - Train the AI by playing games against it.
   - Utilize the training algorithm to improve the AIâ€™s performance.
   - Observe how the AI adapts its strategy over time.
2. Brute Force Algorithm:
   - Generate brute force tablebases for different grid sizes.
   - Understand the optimal moves for each possible game state.
   - Compare the efficiency of brute force versus learned strategies.
3. Engine vs. Engine:
   - Pitch both game engines against each other:
     - AI vs. Brute Force
     - AI vs. Random Move Engine
     - Brute Force vs. Random Move Engine
     - AI vs. AI
   - Analyze the initial cost, and the cost of each iteration for different scenarios.
# Code Structure
The source files are organized within the [src] folder, which contains three sub-folders:

1. game.py:
   - Implements the core game logic for N-dimensional tic-tac-toe.
   - Handles board state, moves, and win conditions.
2. bruteForce.py:
   - Contains code related to the brute force algorithm.
   - Generates lookup tables for different grid sizes.
   - Provides optimal moves based on precomputed data.
3. AI.py:
   - Houses the Q-learning AI implementation.
   - Includes training algorithms and decision-making logic.
   - The code for the AI was adapted from [an opensource gitHub repository](https://github.com/rfeinman/tictactoe-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/tictactoe)

# Running the Program
To initialize the game loop, use the following command:

``python tictactoe.py -gridSize (3/4/5) -x (ai/player/tester) -o (ai/bf) -switchO (0-gridsize) -display gui -games 1``

Replace the placeholders with appropriate values:

1. -x: Choose the player type for X (AI, player, or tester).
2. -o: Choose the player type for O (AI or brute force).
3. -gridSize: Specify the grid size (either 3 or 4 if you want to use the Brute Force algorithm).
4. -games: Specify the number of games to play.
5. -display: Select the display mode ("gui","text" or "off").
6. -switchO: Set the switch position for O (0 to grid size).
7. -aiDataFile: Specify where to store data from AI

Feel free to explore, experiment, and compare the performance of these game engines!
