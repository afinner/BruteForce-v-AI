# AIvBF
This is a repository for implementing and measuring the cost of two game engines a qlearining AI and a brute force algorithm in a game of N-dimensional tic-tac-toe.
A user can train the AI (by playing games against it, or using the training algorithm), generate the brute force tablebases, pitch both game engines against a game engine making a random move or against themselves, and compare their initial cost and the cost of each iteration.
